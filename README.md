### Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Engineer currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano 🇮🇹

I was born and raised in Spain 🇪🇸 but I moved to the USA 🇺🇸 where I obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical-Electronics Engineering and a Minor Degree in Computer Science - Does the word 'Yinzer' sound familiar? ⚫️🟡
