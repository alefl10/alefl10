### Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Engineer currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano 🇮🇹

I was born and raised in Spain 🇪🇸 but I moved to the USA 🇺🇸 where I obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical-Electronics Engineering and a Minor Degree in Computer Science - Does the word 'Yinzer' sound familiar? ⚫️🟡

***

- 💬 I love learning new languages (Spanish, English, Italian down... French 🇫🇷 you're next!)
- 🍝 Wannabe Chef in my spare time
- 💻 You can always catch me working on some React, Flutter or NodeJS project
- ☕️ Coffee and coding. Name a better duo, I'll wait...
- ⚽️ Soccer, 🏓 Ping Pong and ⛳️ Golf are my perfect trifecta
- 🧳 I'm a guy attached to a suitcase. Any trip suggestions?
- 🏡 Real Estate enthusiast
